I created this app from what I learend in the Node.js course, create by Andrew Mead.
This is indeed my first "real world" app that I made in node.js.

Since the course is from 2018 (I think) I had a few additional challanges with API's, since the API's used in the class were no longer working or were extremley limited (200 calls/month) I needed to to connect a new API and figure things out.
