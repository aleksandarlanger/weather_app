 <p> I created this app from what I learend in the Node.js course, create by Andrew Mead: </p>
 
https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/ 


<p> This is my first "real world" app that I made in Node.js. It's not as pretty but it does serve its purpose. </p>
<p> Since the course is from 2018 (I think) I had a few additional challanges with API's, as the API's used in the class were no longer working or were       extremley limited (like 200 calls/month), so I needed to to connect a new API and figure things out on the go. </p>
